Sunela Personal Security Device
===============================

This is the top-level repository of the Sunela project. The goal of the project
is to build hardware and software for a modular security device with the
following characteristics:

- Intended to be owned by one person and used at that person's discretion
- Storage of secrets used for authentication
- Compact form factor that is convenient to keep on the body
- Protection of secrets in everyday situations (loss or theft of the hardware),
  as well as against moderately sophisticated targeted attacks
- The ability to operate both stand-alone (and offline), and also, at the
  owner's choice, in cooperation with other equipment (PC, smartphone)
- Hardware capabilities and modular software design allowing for the addition
  of new protocols and adaptation to new use cases
- Hardware and software open for evaluation by users and 3rd parties

This repository contains mainly reference material. The software and design
files are in additional repositories that should be extracted under this
repository:

  sunela/		This repository
    sunela/fw		Firmware (core system, application)
    sunela/hw		Hardware design files (schematics, layout)
    sunela/me		Mechanical design (CAD drawings, etc.)
    sunela/webui	Web User Interface (runs in a browser)
